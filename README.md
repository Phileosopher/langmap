# The Language Tree: Almost Every Programming Language Ever Made
This is an ambitious language map that covers *all* the programming languages, at least all the ones that were published somewhere.

This map is an ambitious endeavor to give some sense of order to the tech industry.

The idea is that a language's historical evolution can aide in understanding how it originated and give a visual demarcation of how the industry changes.

It's absolutely stunning how fast public information can become arcane, especially in tech, so there are many gaps and pseudo-dates.

Broadly, the map tries to avoid non-original dialects and libraries, though we could probably argue that most languages are simply libraries and dialects.

I've given up editing this, since I have many other projects. Feel free to do what you want with it. The language map opens in Scapple, and I'm open to other options, since it gets a bit bogged down with all the connections.

TO DO LIST:

Input all the languages below

Clean up the language map a little by redirect to later iterations of dialects (most notably Lisp and C)

Move everything around for visual appeal

FUTURE HOPES:

Color-code label by type (e.g., functional, object-oriented, etc)

Make non-arrowed connections for various versions that are loosely related

Get more granular with the versions (SNOBOL4, for example)

Move the languages around to visually represent the spectrum of enterprise/niche, based on its intended purpose it was designed for
